Projectile motion on planet Zava

On Planet Zava there is a lake 1000 m deep with a fluid that has uniform density ρ0 = 2.5 kg/m3.
There is no atmosphere above the lake, so the pressure at depth h is p = ρ0gh, where
g = 9.8 m/s2. A sphere of mass 12 kg and initial volume V0 = 1.5 m3 is launched from the floor
of the lake with initial speed v0 at angle θ = 60° to horizontal.

The sphere has an elastic shell that contains all the mass and is filled with an ideal gas of
negligible mass. During its motion, the sphere exchanges negligible heat with the fluid but has
the same pressure as the fluid. Hence its volume changes adiabatically according to
pV^γ = constant, where γ = 5/3.

the sphere is acted on by its weight, mg, and by the buoyant force
B = ρ0Vg. The lake floor is horizontal, and the intention is that the sphere first lands 1000 m
away, after which it bounces, losing 50% of its kinetic energy at each bounce

Things I still need to add :
1)To take into consideration of buoyancy and the volume changes that happen adiabatically, including the pressure of the elastic shell
2)Ensure the first bounce has a distance of 1000m
